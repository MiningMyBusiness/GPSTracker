# GPS Tracker
Visualization and analysis of self-collected GPS data with homemade GPS module.

## Motivation
The concept of connectivity recives a lot of attention from a wide variety of fields. While we tend to reserve the main discussions about connectivity to the digital realm, I find myself drawn to the concept of connectivity in the physical world. Where we travel everyday and how we get there influences directly a lot of what we are exposed to and what is exposed to us.   

I wanted to know how connected (or disconnected) I was to the rest of Chicago, the city where I live. I decided to measure this by tracking everywhere I go every day. I hope that this will give me an idea about how I move and where I go in this city. Data from individuals about traveling behavior in the city would provide insight into health (walking or not), how people are using public transportation, carbon footprint of individual people, and the web of places the average Chicagoan visits based on their location.

## Hardware
The homemade GPS module consisting of Arduino Nano, an SD card module, a passive cermaic GPS module, a 3.7V to 5V boost converter and a LiPo battery. A schematic is shown below but more detail can be found in the [Hardware](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/GPSTracker/raw/master/Hardware) folder of the repository.

I implemented the beta version of this hardware in a carboard Sparkfun box shown below. This was adequately portable to collect pilot data.
